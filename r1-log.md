The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 19, Wednesday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1 
Continued the first semester project on Visualisation of Sorting Algorithms, and worked on Hacker Rank challenges.
Learnt about List Comprehensions, and some nice use cases
Have to still implement Merge Sort and Quick Sort differently.

### R1D2
Learnt about symmetric difference using ^ operator on sets, Garbage Collection.
Tried to fix the merge sort and quick sort implementation, but struggled with it, and will try again :(
Tried a bunch of problems on HackerRank, and got all of them to work :)
Fixed a few bugs with animations.

### R1D3
Took part in NexCode, on HackerRank
Solved like 3 completely
and a bunch partially
Need to try the questions I didn't get completely, and didn't read at all due to length
