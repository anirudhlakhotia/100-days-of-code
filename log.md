### Day 1: January 20, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Hacker Rank challenges, and fixed bugs with Visualisation to Bubble and Insertion Sort

**Thoughts:** I didnt struggle with most of the challenges, some caught my eye. I struggled with the Merge Sort and Quick Sort implementation changes, will need to look at them again. Could improve efficiency of a few submitted solutions too!

### Day 2: January 22, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Took part in a 3 hour competitive coding event, on Hacker Rank

**Thoughts:** Struggled with most challenges, only got partial test cases, maybe because i didn't check for empty array cases, but a few problems still need a good solution, could have done better overall.
