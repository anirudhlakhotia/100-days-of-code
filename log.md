# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 19, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Hacker Rank challenges, and added Visualisation to Bubble and Insertion Sort

**Thoughts:** I didnt struggle with the challenges too much, learnt a few things about List Comprehension. Could work on efficiency

### Day 1: January 20, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Hacker Rank challenges, and fixed bugs with Visualisation to Bubble and Insertion Sort

**Thoughts:** I didnt struggle with most of the challenges, some caught my eye. I struggled with the Merge Sort and Quick Sort implementation changes, will need to look at them again. Could improve efficiency of a few submitted solutions too!

### Day 2: January 22, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Took part in a 3 hour competitive coding event, on Hacker Rank

**Thoughts:** Struggled with most challenges, only got partial test cases, maybe because i didn't check for empty array cases, but a few problems still need a good solution, could have done better overall.

### Day 3: January 24, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Tried a few questions on Number representation, and iterators in Python, and a few Hacker Rank challenges that I hadn't got from the event

**Thoughts:** Need to better understand the concepts in Python, and how to use them.

### Day 4: January 25, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Fixed all the implementation issues i.e.  Merge Sort and Quick Sort in the first semester project, and enhanced the project with a timer and some other features

**Thoughts:** Still don't have a concrete understanding of generators but then the problems are now fixed

### Day 5: February 3, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Fixed a bunch of issues with covidash, and got tensorflow running on my laptop :)

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I've worked on covidash, and I'm glad a few things have been fixed. The code is a bit messy, but I'll try to clean it up soon. The ML model is still buggy, with a MASE of 1.26 :( but I'll try to fix it soon

### Day 6: February 6, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Started working on a Discord Bot for Research stuff

**Thoughts:** It was really refreshing to work on something different, and I'm glad I tried something new. I'll try to improve it soon.
